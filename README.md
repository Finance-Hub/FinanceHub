# Welcome to the Finance Lab

The Finance Lab is an attempt to create a community of investment
professionals and academics in Brazil capable of fostering the research
and technology that will help the Brazilian asset management industry
cope with its new challenges.

## Background
There has been an explosion of interest in systematic trading strategies
(STS). Varying in complexity, STS is now mainstream and part of any
large institutional portfolio.

Top investment firms in the world have moved away from the
“secret-sauce” mindset and now co-author research with academics,
dedicate resources to education, create new
technologies, construct publicly available data sets, and run labs in markets, data science,
and technology. They are even bringing open source technology to
investing itself. The Brazilian asset management industry is late in
this process with very few teams fully dedicated to a systematic
approach to investing.

Brazilian portfolios are becoming more international, multi-dimensional
and complex. Systematization is a transparent and efficient way of
institutional investors to deal with complexity and lack familiarity
with certain markets. Our professionals need to be trained in the
sciences and technologies of this new approach. We need to start
building a more symbiotic relationship with academia. The Finance Lab is
an attempt to create a community of investment professionals and
academics in Brazil capable of doing just that, fostering the research
and technology that will help the Brazilian asset management industry
cope with its new challenges.

We have ambitious goals but we are starting small. So far, we have
created an open source [repository for code](https://github.com/gusamarante/FinanceLab) and data to reduce the effort
of conducting research in finance. We are setting up courses that give
the fundamental background in the sciences and technologies needed for
the academic-investment firm relationship to flourish. We are setting up
seminars where academics and professionals can discuss research
projects.
