# Welcome to the FinanceHub Repository

The FinanceHub is a **community** of investment professionals, academics
and students in Brazil capable of fostering the research and technology
that will help the brazilian asset management industry cope with its new
challenges. To learn more about the FinanceHub, check out [our website](https://financehub.community).

The role of this repository is to reduce the cost of research in quantitative finance.
Data, methods and models are available for you to use in your research project.

Here we speak **python**.
There have been people wanting to contribute in other languages but we want to keep this repository exclusive to python.
If you would like to help us in the development of this library, please have a look at our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Finance-Hub/FinanceHub/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

This library will soon be available at PyPi for installation. Our first release will be out soon.
