# Welcome to the FinanceHub

The FinanceHub is a **community** of investment professionals, academics
and students in Brazil capable of fostering the research and technology
that will help the brazilian asset management industry cope with its new
challenges.

## Background
There has been an explosion of interest in systematic trading strategies
(STS). Varying in complexity, STS is now mainstream and part of any
large institutional portfolio.

Top investment firms in the world have moved away from the
“secret-sauce” mindset and now co-author research with academics,
dedicate resources to education, create new technologies, construct
publicly available data sets, and run labs in markets, data science,
and technology. They are even bringing open source technology to
investing itself. The Brazilian asset management industry is late in
this process with very few teams fully dedicated to a systematic
approach to investing.

Brazilian portfolios are becoming more international, multi-dimensional
and complex. Systematization is a transparent and efficient way of
institutional investors to deal with complexity and lack familiarity
with certain markets. Our professionals need to be trained in the
sciences and technologies of this new approach. We need to start
building a more symbiotic relationship with academia. The FinanceHub is
an attempt to create a community of investment professionals and
academics in Brazil capable of doing just that, fostering the research
and technology that will help the Brazilian asset management industry
cope with its new challenges.

## What We Do

* **Technology**: We built a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Finance-Hub/FinanceHub) with codes to support
research in finance. Some code helps easily access raw and treated data
stored in our servers. Some code implements models used on the analysis
of that data. The objective of this branch is to build tools for
research which will reduce the cost of data acquisition as well as model
set up.

* **Education**: We have lectures on [python programming](https://github.com/Finance-Hub/FinanceHubMaterials/tree/master/Python%20Lectures) for finance and
financial theory. All of the material is available in our repository in
the format of slides and jupyter notebooks, so that everyone can learn
python and help build up the community and push the project forward.

* **Research**: Investment professionals from BWGI and Itaú Asset
Management and academics from Insper are the initial members of this
community and activaly discuss research.  To promote this branch we are
organizing academic [seminars](https://github.com/Finance-Hub/FinanceHubMaterials/tree/master/Seminars) on the relevant 
topics and curating a repository of academic research papers on the [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) plataform.

# Seminars

Participation in this Seminar is by invitation only. Please contact us
if you would like to attend, but space is limited and we may not be able
to welcome you immediately. Each session will have at least two
presentations of around 45 minutes, including discussion and Q&A. We
also welcome original research, but the Seminar coordinator will
evaluate whether your research fits the objectives of this Seminar.

Presenter is expected to present the main features of the paper, promote
a brief discussion with suggestions for changes or future research and
should be able to address questions by all participants. Participants
should come prepared for discussion. All are expected to read at least
the introduction of all papers. Participants should focus the discussion
on the themes related to the paper presentations. The role of the
Seminar coordinator is to guide the discussion during the presentations,
select topics together with participants and plan sessions. At the end
of the session, we welcome general discussions.
