    "# Section 0 - Jupyter Notebook and Markdown Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The jupyter notebook is an interactive programming environment that is made up of **code cells** and **text cells**. Text cells allow you to use not only plain text but also some commands to format it. These commands are called the **Markdown Syntax**. This notebook contains examples of what this syntax can do in the jupyter environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This formatted text you are reading right now is the result of the code. In order to see how the structures are generated, see the contents of each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you go through this notebook, double-click each cell to see how their contents were generated. The markdown syntax is very intuitive and straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we start...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use the Jupyter Notebook environmet?\n",
    "> Notebooks have rapidly grown in popularity among data scientists to become the *de facto* standard for quick prototyping and exploratory analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Replication**: This environment allows for reproduceble worflows, which is specially interesting for scientific research.\n",
    "* **Computational narratives**: Since you can add comments, pictures and even formulas in between code cells, it is very easy to explain what you are doing and comment the results of each step.\n",
    "* **Good teaching**: Like a presentation, it helps organize the flow of a lecture, since all the students have the code already typed.\n",
    "* **Language Agnostic**: The standard jupyter notebook supports **Ju**lia, **Py**thon and **R** (hence the name, Jupyter), but you can download and install kernels for any major programming language.\n",
    "* **Big companies are using it**: Here is an example from [netflix](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233)\n",
